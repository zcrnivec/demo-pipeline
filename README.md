# Demo Pipeline

The project is designed to provide a starting point in setting up CI/CI pipeline with [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and demonstrate integration with Cisco Webex Teams Bot. The system is ready for Kubernetes deployment

## Demo Pipeline License

This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

## Installation on Kubernetes

The primary use of the project is CI/CD pipeline deployed in Kubernetes.

```shell
kubectl apply -f sample-app.yaml
```
